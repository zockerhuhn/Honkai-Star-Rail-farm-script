I am not liable for any inconvenience the script might cause including spending ressources.

# Features

## Working
Restart combat after done with challenge.

Automatically refresh trailblaze power according to your settings (you decide what kind of ressources can be used).

Exit the challenge completed screen when desired amount of rewards or waves are reached

Close game after reaching desired reward amount if that setting is set to true

Decide a character which gets ignored when they are down

supports farming materials, relics and bosses. Setting it to relics only counts waves so you can use it for any activity with the normal challenge completed screen

## Planned
Revive characters that got downed in combat

# Known Issues
Does not yet retry if the whole team dies

# How to use

## Installing the script

Go to the releases page and download the newest release (link:https://github.com/zockerhuhn/Honkai-Star-Rail-farm-script/releases)

Follow the instructions of the installer (setting a menu shortcut is advisable)

## Using the script

To start the script run the Autofarmer app as administrator. (main.exe in the files)  (_For some reason Star Rail requieres you to have administrator privileges to use the mouse while tabbed into the game_)

Change the settings to your needs

In Star Rail start your desired combat _domain_, choose your characters and enter combat (turn on autoplay)

Press start in the window with the settings, tab into Star Rail and you're good to go, the script will stop as soon as the desired reward amount is reached.

To end the script early simply go into the Terminal and press 'ctrl + c'

## Updating the script

To update the script simply go to the releases site again and download the new updatet version.  _depending on how difficult it is I might add an installer in the future that updates automatically_

# FAQ 

## Will I be banned for using this script?
While I can't and won't gurantee anything, probably not. I have been testing and using this script since over 2 months now and haven't been banned. All this script does is take Screenshots of small regions of the screen and use tesseract to read the text onscreen. Then it imitates a mouse and presses the right buttons according to the state of the game in the screenshot. You can test this by simply looking at a screenshot instead of ingame and the script won't know the difference.
